# 01-maze-audiocode-smeerws

### Project description: 
This project serves as sample project for spatial audio. 
Explore sound in its basics in virtual reality (VR).

### Development platform: 
OS: Windows 10, Game Engine: Unity 2019.1.14f1, Visual Studio 2019, Steam,  
SteamVR 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.5.0)

Note on Unity Version 2019.1.14f1 and SteamVR: The SteamVr plugin has many issues when used with Unity Versions > 2019.1.3 because the XR Management System changed from 2019.1.3 to 2019.1.4. Valve is working on it, so we will use these older versions for the VR programming.
